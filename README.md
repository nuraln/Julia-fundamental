# Julia-fundamental

Welcome to the Fundamental Programming with Julia repository! This repository contains essential programming examples and exercises implemented in the Julia programming language. It covers fundamental concepts such as factorial computation and login/logout functionality. This README file serves as a guide to help you navigate and understand the contents of this repository.

## Factorial
The factorial.jl file provides an implementation of factorial computation in Julia. It includes a function factorial(n) that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer n. You can use this file to understand the concept of recursion and how factorial computation works.
Login and Logout

## Login & Logout
The login_logout.jl file demonstrates a simple login and logout system. It showcases the implementation of a login function login(username, password) and a logout function logout(). You can study this file to learn how to handle user authentication and session management in Julia.
